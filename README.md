    <h1>Anti-Theft Two-Wheeler Protection System</h1>
    
    <p>The Anti-Theft Two-Wheeler Protection System is a project designed to enhance the security of two-wheelers, preventing theft and unauthorized usage. The system is composed of a mobile application and a microprocessor unit connected to a relay system installed in the vehicle.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remote Control:</strong> The project allows users to control the ignition system of their two-wheeler remotely using a dedicated mobile application.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignition Control:</strong> With the installed microprocessor and relay system, users can remotely prevent the bike from starting or stop it even if it's in motion.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Application:</strong> The mobile application provides an intuitive interface for users to manage and control their two-wheeler's security settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> The system may include features for real-time monitoring, providing users with notifications and alerts in case of any suspicious activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>The microprocessor unit installed in the two-wheeler is connected to the ignition system through a relay. The mobile application communicates with the microprocessor unit over a secure connection, allowing users to send commands to control the bike's ignition.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>Users can easily set up the Anti-Theft Two-Wheeler Protection System by installing the microprocessor unit in their vehicle and downloading the mobile application. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing security settings and remotely controlling the bike's ignition.</p>
